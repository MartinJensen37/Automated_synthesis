# Automated_synthesis
This repository is contains code and documentation for operating the automatic synthesis robot cell. This will contain both code for a real-life demonstration as well as a simulated environment in which the robot can operate.

## Communication Structure

The communication between the robot, computer and pipette is mainly done using MQTT and Robot Operating System(ROS). MQTT is a lightweight publish-subscribe network protocol that can transport messeges between devices. MQTT is usually used in IoT and IIoT for communication between a server and set of sensors.
